1.2 In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. A common example is the conversion of a sound wave (a continuous signal) to a sequence of samples (a discrete-time signal).\cite{wiki:Sampler}
so, basically a sampler records the signal value at particular time intervals. Here the sampler records the signal $\sin(t)$ at intervals of $k\pi/4$ where k is an integer.
